# IF.03.01 Basic Web Technique Winter 2017

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice all dynamic features of Css.

## Materials
If you work under macOS you will be already very familiar with the environment using

- Atom
- Chrome or Safari
- GitHub.

If you are working on a Windows machine then you need an alternative editor. Atom is available also on Windows. Furthermore you can use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.html). Working with GitHub and Chrome is basically the same as under macOS.

Furthermore you may require your cheat sheets you have prepared so far or you consult the links in the prior ReadingAssignments in case you get in troubles with html/css issues.

Finally it might be possible to use Photoshop or a similar software to adapt images to your web site. Please take care that this is not a design course so the creation of stunning images is not part of the course. Rather we use images to try to convey our basic ideas.

## Required Tasks
0. Copy the files of your site as it was handed in for the coding assignment 2. Take care that you **do not** copy the .git directory, since it would mess up your repository.

1. Make a concept, how to integrate the following css 3 features into your website.
   - Transitions
   - Animations
   - Transformations
   - Shadows
   - Linear and/or radial gradients
   - Rounded corners

2. Implement your concept on your website.

3. Add a page `changelog.html` to your site which lists all changes from coding assignment 2 to coding assignment 3. Concentrate on the implemented css3 features. Describe the feature and link to the corresponding page of your site.


## Things to Learn
- Css 3

## Evaluation
All coding assignments will get checked. Most common reasons that your assignment is marked down are:

- Project's Html pages do not validate
- One or more items in the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read
- Content is not sufficient to evaluate whether the technical implementations are sufficient.

Finally check the [Rubrics](Rubrics.md) (Units 1 to 6 and "All" at the end of the table) to remember which criteria we use when checking your code.
